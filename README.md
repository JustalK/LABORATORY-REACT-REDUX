# LABORATORY - REACT REDUX

## Goal

This project is a laboratory for the library react-redux. You will find in this repository a compilation of my tries, tests and experimentation with `React-Redux` and more particularly with the hook of redux.
Feel free to try the repository.

Everything work fine as describe below.

## Plan of the presentation

I explain with all the details how I build the project and my way of working.

- [Running](#running)
- [Commands](#commands)

## Experiences

- **store1**: Testing the old connect API
- **store2**: Testing the hooks with the slice of the toolkit
- **store3**: Testing the hooks with multiple slice

- **store5**: Creating a selector using reselect for memoizing state
- **store6**: Memoizing dispatch function
- **store7**: Make use of UseStore for replacing the reducers
- **store8**: Checking how the children affect the re-rendering of the parent
- **store9**: Creating a slice with async call (middleware)
- **store10**: Testing how to use entity with createEntityAdapter
- **store11**: Testing the add, remove, update of the createEntityAdapter
- **store12**: Using RTK Query for querying like Apollo
- **store13**: Testing the option of a RTK query  
- **store14**: Testing the option of a RTK mutation
- **store15**: Playing with the cache system of RTK

## Running

For running the API, a single command is needed.

```
npm run start
```

## Commands

- **npm run start**: Run the linter and then the project
- **npm run build**: Build the project
- **npm run test**: Run the test of the project
- **npm run eject**: Eject the application (sometimes necessary)
- **npm run linter:fix**: Run the linter and fix the errors
- **npm run build:docs**: Build the documentation from the comments in the code
- **npm run check-update**: Check if the package are up to date (for now, everything is except the testing and webvital)
